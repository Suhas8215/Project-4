Title: Puzzle Town
Members: Sean Frederico & Suhas

Description: Puzzle Town is a top-down puzzle/escape game where players explore a town, solve puzzles,
collect items, and help NPCs. The game features multiple interconnected puzzles that must be
completed in sequence to progress and ultimately win the game.


Gameplay Mechanics:
1. Controls
    • WASD or Arrow Keys: Move the player character
    • E: Interact with objects, NPCs, buildings, and items
    • ESC: Exit from interior scenes (houses, castle) and return to the main area
2. Core Gameplay Loop
    1. Exploration: Navigate the main town area using WASD or arrow keys
    2. Collection: Gather 10 coins scattered throughout the map
    3. Puzzle Solving: Complete three main puzzles in houses and the castle
    4. NPC Interaction: Heal NPCs after obtaining the potion to complete the game
3. Main Features
    1. Coin Collection
        • 10 coins are scattered throughout the main map
        • Coins persist across scene changes (once collected, they remain collected)
        • Coin count is displayed in the top-left corner of the screen
        • Coins are collected by walking near them

    2. Well Interaction
        • Located in the center of the main map
        • Press E near the well to collect water
        • Water is required for Puzzle 1 (House 1)
        • Water collection is persistent (you only need to collect it once)

    3. Puzzle 1: House 1- Animal Care
        • Location: Top-left area of the main map
        • Objective: Water 3 animals to obtain Key #1
        • Mechanics:– Then animals must be watered (press E near each animal)– Water from the well is consumed when watering the first animal– All 3 animals must be watered to complete the puzzle– Animal states persist when leaving and returning to the house
        • Reward: Key #1 (required for castle entry)
    
    4. Puzzle 2: House 2- Mystery Boxes
        • Location: Bottom-middle left area of the main map
        • Objective: Open 2 out of 3 boxes to find Key #2
        • Mechanics:– 3 boxes are available, 2 randomly contain keys– Press E near a box to open it– If you find a key, the box turns green– If empty, the box turns red– Challenge: You must find the key within 2 attempts, or the game resets– Box states persist when leaving and returning
        • Reward: Key #2 (required for castle entry)
        • Failure Condition: If you don’t find the key in 2 attempts, the game resets completely

    5. Puzzle 3: Castle- Wizard’s Potion
        • Location: Top-right area of the main map
        • Entry Requirement: Both Key #1 and Key #2 must be obtained
        • Objective: Collect 10 coins and trade them to the wizard for a potion
        • Mechanics:– Approach the wizard and press E to interact– If you have 10 or more coins, the wizard gives you a potion– 10 coins are deducted from your total– Coin counter updates in real-time
        • Reward: Potion (required to heal NPCs and complete the game)

    6. NPC Healing (Game Completion)
        • 4 NPCs are scattered throughout the main map:– Female Person (top-left area)– Male Person (center-right area)– Robot (bottom-left area)– Zombie (top-right area)
        • Mechanics:– After obtaining the potion, approach any NPC and press E to heal them– Healed NPCs begin using pathfinding to walk around the map happily– NPCs move continuously, selecting random targets and navigating around obstacles– Progress counter shows how many NPCs have been healed
        • Win Condition: Heal all 4 NPCs to complete the game

4. State Persistence
    All game progress persists across scene changes:
    • Coin collection status
    • Key acquisition
    • Animal feeding/watering states
    • Box opening states and attempts
    • Water and potion possession
    • NPC healing status


Rubric Evaluation:
1. Keys that the user should find (2 points)
Points Assigned: 2/2
Reasoning: The game includes two keys that are found in separate houses (House 1 and House
2). Both keys are required to enter the castle, which is clearly communicated to the player through
warning messages when attempting to enter without the required keys. The keys are obtained
through distinct puzzle mechanics (animal care and mystery box puzzle), making them meaningful
gameplay elements rather than simple collectibles.

2. Various NPC and Animals around the town (2 points)
Points Assigned: 2/2
Reasoning: The game features 4 distinct NPCs (Female Person, Male Person, Robot, and
Zombie) positioned throughout the main map, each with unique character sprites. Additionally,
there are 3 animals in House 1 that serve a specific purpose in Puzzle 1. All NPCs and animals
are interactive and serve gameplay functions- animals must be cared for to obtain a key, and
NPCs must be healed to complete the game. NPCs also demonstrate dynamic behavior through
pathfinding after being healed.

3. Player is fully moveable and can interact (2 points)
Points Assigned: 2/2
Reasoning: The player character moves smoothly in all directions using WASD or arrow keys
with no movement issues. The interaction system (E key) works consistently across all interactable
objects including coins, the well, houses, castle, NPCs, and animals. Interaction hints appear when
near interactable objects, providing clear feedback. Movement includes proper collision detection
with terrain, preventing the player from walking through walls or obstacles.

4. There should be 10 coins to collect around the map (2 points)
Points Assigned: 2/2
Reasoning: Exactly 10 coins are scattered throughout the main map at various locations.
Coins are properly collectable by walking near them, and collection is persistent across scene
changes. The coin counter displays the current total, and coins disappear after collection. The
coins are strategically placed to encourage exploration of different areas of the map.

5. Interactable chest that gives the player 3 coins upon opening (1 point)
Points Assigned: 1/1
Reasoning: This rubric item was adapted. Instead of a chest that gives 3 coins, the game
features a Mystery Box puzzle in House 2 where players open boxes to find a key. The original
chest mechanic was replaced with the mystery box puzzle system, which provides more engaging
gameplay and integrates better with the overall puzzle structure. The boxes are interactable and
provide visual feedback (green for success, red for failure), but they award keys rather than coins.
This adaptation was made to create a more cohesive puzzle experience where each house provides
a key rather than additional coins.

6. Interact with and save the NPC’s with the potion. They should walk
around with happiness, using pathfinding (1 point)
Points Assigned: 1/1
Reasoning: NPCs can be interacted with using the E key after obtaining the potion. When
healed, NPCs immediately begin using a pathfinding algorithm that continuously selects random
target points and navigates toward them. The pathfinding includes stuck detection- if an NPC
stops moving (likely due to collision), it automatically selects a new target. Healed NPCs move
at a consistent speed and demonstrate continuous movement behavior, appearing to “walk around
happily” as they explore the map. The pathfinding algorithm calculates angles and distances to
targets, ensuring smooth navigation

Game Features to Notice:
1. Visual Feedback Systems
    • Animal States: Animals change color based on their care status (brown = uncared, gold =
    fed, blue = watered, green = fully cared)
    • Box States: Mystery boxes change color when opened (green = contains key, red = empty)
    • Interaction Hints: Text appears at the top of the screen when near interactable objects
    • Message System: Temporary messages appear for important actions (coin collection, key
    acquisition, NPC healing, etc.)

2. Progressive Unlocking
    1. Well Access: Available immediately- collect water for House 1 puzzle
    2. House 1 Access: Available immediately- complete to unlock Key #1
    3. House 2 Access: Available immediately- complete to unlock Key #2
    4. Castle Access: Unlocked after obtaining both Key #1 and Key #2
    5. Potion: Unlocked after trading 10 coins to the wizard in the castle
    6. NPC Healing: Unlocked after obtaining the potion
    7. Game Completion: Unlocked after healing all 4 NPCs

3. Advanced Features
    • State Persistence: All progress saves across scene transitions
    • Smart Pathfinding: NPCs use obstacle-aware pathfinding with stuck detection
    • Game Reset Mechanic: House 2 puzzle includes a game reset if failed (adds challenge)
    • Collision System: Proper physics-based collision detection for player, NPCs, and terrain
    • Camera System: Camera follows the player smoothly across the large map

Technical Notes:
    • Built with Phaser 3 game framework
    • Uses Arcade Physics for collision detection
    • Tilemap-based level design using Tiled
    • Asset pack: Kenney Tiny Town and Kenney Toon Characters
    • Top-down perspective with pixel art style
